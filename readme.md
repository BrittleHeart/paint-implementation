# Introduction

Welcome to my Paint project. This is simple implementation of paint with [Color Picker](https://taufik-nurrohman.js.org/color-picker/) and vanilla Javascript usage.

## How to start

First of all install all dependencies - Do't be afraid, there's only one to go ðŸ˜…

```bash
npm install
```

If you have server installed on your [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), run it

Or if u just want to have fun open **index.html** in your favourite browser and have fun ðŸ¤“

## Database connection
